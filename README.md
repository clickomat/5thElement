Our goal with Accessible travel is to: create safe, sensory friendly certified travel options for parents and individuals on the spectrum. 

Taking a vacation together, as a family, can be one of the bigger challenges with having a family member who has sensory processing complications.
 
 Our site provides parents with a community to share ideas, plan trips with other families, review destinations, and explore travel options at some of the most beautiful places in the world. 

As a parent of an individual on the spectrum you can be assured that the destinations featured on Accesible Travel have been certified or highly recommended by those in the Autism community.
