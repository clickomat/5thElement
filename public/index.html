    <P>
        Our goal with Accessible travel is to: create safe, sensory friendly certified travel options for parents and individuals
        on the spectrum. </P>
    <P>Taking a vacation together, as a family, can be one of the bigger challenges with having a family member who has sensory
        processing complications.</P>
    <P>Our site provides parents with a community to share ideas, plan trips with other families, review destinations, and explore
        travel options at some of the most beautiful places in the world.</P>
    <P>As a parent of an individual on the spectrum you can be assured that the destinations featured on Accesible Travel have
        been certified or highly recommended by those in the Autism community.</P>
